Find the job profiles that have the most openings due to lack of qualified workers. If there are many opening jobs of a job profile but at the same time there are many qualified jobless people. Then training cannot help fill up this type of job. What we want to find is such a job profile that has the largest difference between vacancies (the unfilled jobs of this job profile) and the number of jobless people who are qualified for this job profile.
